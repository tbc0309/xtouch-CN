## OneWire

```
Copyright (c) 2007, Jim Studt (original old version - many contributors since)

The latest version of this library may be found at:
http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html

OneWire has been maintained by Paul Stoffregen (paul@pjrc.com) since
January 2010.

DO NOT EMAIL for technical support, especially not for ESP chips!
All project support questions must be posted on public forums
relevant to the board or chips used. If using Arduino, post on
Arduino's forum. If using ESP, post on the ESP community forums.
There is ABSOLUTELY NO TECH SUPPORT BY PRIVATE EMAIL!

Github's issue tracker for OneWire should be used only to report
specific bugs. DO NOT request project support via Github. All
project and tech support questions must be posted on forums, not
github issues. If you experience a problem and you are not
absolutely sure it's an issue with the library, ask on a forum
first. Only use github to report issues after experts have
confirmed the issue is with OneWire rather than your project.

Back in 2010, OneWire was in need of many bug fixes, but had
been abandoned the original author (Jim Studt). None of the known
contributors were interested in maintaining OneWire. Paul typically
works on OneWire every 6 to 12 months. Patches usually wait that
long. If anyone is interested in more actively maintaining OneWire,
please contact Paul (this is pretty much the only reason to use
private email about OneWire).

OneWire is now very mature code. No changes other than adding
definitions for newer hardware support are anticipated.

Add target_search() function, Scott Roberts

Version 2.1:
Arduino 1.0 compatibility, Paul Stoffregen
Improve temperature example, Paul Stoffregen
DS250x_PROM example, Guillermo Lovato
PIC32 (chipKit) compatibility, Jason Dangel, dangel.jason AT gmail.com
Improvements from Glenn Trewitt:

- check_crc16() does all of calculation/checking work.
- Added read_bytes() and write_bytes(), to reduce tedious loops.
- Added ds2408 example.
  Delete very old, out-of-date readme file (info is here)

Version 2.0: Modifications by Paul Stoffregen, January 2010:
http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html
Search fix from Robin James
http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1238032295/27#27
Use direct optimized I/O in all cases
Disable interrupts during timing critical sections
(this solves many random communication errors)
Disable interrupts during read-modify-write I/O
Reduce RAM consumption by eliminating unnecessary
variables and trimming many to 8 bits
Optimize both crc8 - table version moved to flash

Modified to work with larger numbers of devices - avoids loop.
Tested in Arduino 11 alpha with 12 sensors.
26 Sept 2008 -- Robin James
http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1238032295/27#27

Updated to work with arduino-0008 and to include skip() as of
2007/07/06. --RJL20

Modified to calculate the 8-bit CRC directly, avoiding the need for
the 256-byte lookup table to be loaded in RAM. Tested in arduino-0010
-- Tom Pollard, Jan 23, 2008

Jim Studt's original library was modified by Josh Larios.

Much of the code was inspired by Derek Yerger's code, though I don't
think much of that remains. In any event that was..
(copyleft) 2006 by Derek Yerger - Free to distribute freely.

The CRC code was excerpted and inspired by the Dallas Semiconductor
sample code bearing this copyright.

# Optional board audio

S3/P4 optional sound support uses Espressif `esp_codec_dev` 1.5.9 (Apache-2.0), selected for P4's ES8311 codec. The dependency manager retains the component's license. S3's PCM5101 output uses the ESP-IDF I2S driver. No third-party sound recordings are included; short tones are synthesized locally.

# Web installer

The optional static website in `web/` uses [ESP Web Tools](https://github.com/esphome/esp-web-tools), licensed under Apache-2.0. It is bundled from the pinned npm package during website deployment. Its license is copied into the generated site's `licenses/esp-web-tools/` directory; bundled dependency notices are retained in generated JavaScript. esbuild is a build-time dependency licensed under MIT. ESP Web Tools runs in the browser. esbuild also minifies the firmware management portal during builds.

The P4 revision-3+ installer includes Espressif [esp-flasher-stub v1.4.1](https://github.com/espressif/esp-flasher-stub/releases/tag/v1.4.1), dual licensed under Apache-2.0 OR MIT. Its licenses and provenance are in `web/flasher/` and copied into the website's `licenses/esp-flasher-stub/` directory. Targeted build patches retain the pinned esptool-js API while updating P4 detection and revision handling.

Browser installation uses [SparkMD5 3.0.2](https://github.com/satazor/js-spark-md5) to compare written segments with device checksums. Its alternative MIT license is included in `web/flasher/LICENSE.spark-md5` and in the generated website.

P4 register setup and revision decoding follow Espressif esptool 5.6.0 (GPL-2.0-or-later). Attribution and the upstream license are retained in `web/flasher/NOTICE.md` and `LICENSE.esptool`; the adaptation follows this project's GPLv3 license.

## OPPO Sans 4.0

OPPO Sans（含中文及西文，3 款字重）允许个人或企业免费使用，含商业用途，版权归 OPPO 广东移动通信有限公司所有。

OPPO Sans (Chinese and Western characters, three weights) is free for personal and business use, including commercial use. Copyright belongs to OPPO Guangdong Mobile Communications Co., Ltd.

The firmware uses an OPPO Sans 4.0 subset at weight 600. Japanese kana and Korean characters absent from the supplied font use Noto Sans CJK fallback glyphs. The original TTF is not included. The free-use notice does not relicense the fonts under the project software license.

Official notice: [OPPO / ColorOS](https://www.coloros.com/article/A00000050/). Supplementary font licenses: [Noto Sans CJK](docs/licenses/NotoSansCJK-OFL.txt).
